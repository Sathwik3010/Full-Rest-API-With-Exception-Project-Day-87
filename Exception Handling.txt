·   	@RestControllerAdvice used for global error handling in the Spring MVC application.
·        It allows you to handle exceptions across the whole application, not just to an individual controller and also has full control over the body of the response and the status code.
·        GlobalExceptionHandler was annotated with @RestControllerAdvice, thus it is going to intercept exceptions from controllers across the application.

·        The @ExceptionHandler is an annotation used to handle the specific exceptions and sending the custom responses to the client.
Development Steps
·   	Create your own exception classes:
·       One Controller advice class per Application
·       Write a @ ExceptionHandler method
·   	Handle the Status Code based on our needs
H2 Database:
·   	H2 is an embedded database provided by Spring Boot
·       H2 is a relational database management system written in java.
·       It is in-memory database.
·       H2 provides web console to maintain the database (or) Browser based console application.
·       H2 database is available when you start your spring boot application and it will drop when you stop the spring boot application.
·   	It is generally used in unit testing.
·   	It stores data in memory, not persist the data on disk.
 
 
 
Rest Client:
·       Any application/Tool/Human which is cable of Sending HTTP Request can act as REST Client.
o   Python project can act as REST Client
o   Net Project can act as REST client
o   Java Project Can act as REST Client
o   Angular & React Projects also can act as REST Clients
o   POSTMAN & Swagger-UI tools are acting as REST Clients.
How to Develop REST Client using JAVA
·   	Rest Client can be developed in 2 ways using Spring MVC
1)  Rest Template
2)  Web Client
·       Rest Template supports Synchronous communication
o   After Making a request it will block the thread until we receive the response
·   	Web Client supports both synchronous and asynchronous Communication.
o   Asynchronous communication means after making a request it won't wait for the response it will continue its execution further.
o   Mono Same as RestTemplate – Single Request -> Single Response
o   Flux – Single Request -> Multiple Responses
Difference between SOAP vs REST SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):
·       Protocol-based: Defines a strict protocol for describing messages, data types, and operations.
·       XML-based: Uses XML for data exchange, ensuring platform and language independence.
·       Stateful: Maintains context between requests and responses for complex transactions.
·       Security features built-in: Provides WS-Security standards for authentication and authorization.
·   	Mature and widely supported: Extensive tooling and libraries available.
REST (Representational State Transfer):
·       Architectural style: Defines principles for designing web services based on HTTP methods and resources.
·   	Flexible data formats: Supports various formats like JSON, XML, plain text, etc.
·       Stateless: Each request is independent and self-contained.
·       Simple and lightweight: Easier to learn and implement compared to SOAP.
·   	Scalable and efficient: Less overhead due to stateless nature.
·   	Restful APIs are Simple: Used by the majority of modern web services and APIs.
